            <p>I am currently studying at Simon Fraser University, School of Interactive Art and Technology. I am passionate about media design, videography and animation. Through visual, audio and narration both videography and animation are able to communicate a story to the audience. With these medium I am able to connect the audience's emotion with the narrator or the character's emotion.</p>

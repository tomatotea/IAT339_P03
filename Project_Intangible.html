      <p> “Intangible” is a series of 6 short documentary film of Coast Salish Artist for Bill Reid Gallery’s exhibition Intangible: Memory and Innovation in Coast Salish Art. This 3 minutes short documentary project is produced by a team of three, Evan Ray Prawira and Justina Chen, I. The purpose of this documentary film is to present the intangible concept and value that motivated Roxanne Charles to create her artwork. The role I took in this project planning storyboard, filming, setting up light equipment, editing video footage, and editing sound file. </p>

      <h3>Pre-Production </h3>
      <p>The first challenge we encounter was the filming location, initially we wanted to film at Roxannes’ studio, however, Roxanne was working on a larger project at the time and there was not much room left to place the equipment. As a result, I changed the filming location to White Rock Museum where Roxanne was having an exhibition. White Rock Museum is located beside a train track so we had to consistently stop recording and wait for the train, another issue was the showroom is really small and full of art piece so we have to carefully position the camera and lights. </p>

      <h3>Post-Production</h3>
      <p>One of the hardest process was to edit the 40 minutes interview to 3 minutes narration. I was assigned to edit the sound file and video footage and one of the challenges that I faced was the room tone and noise of the sound recording, although in the end I was not able to clear all the noise and pop but the sound recording sounded more natural and smooth. Furthermore, due to the interview location the background of the interview subject was distracted, to allow the audience to focus on Roxanne rather than the background I made a few versions of iteration used After Effect. In the end, the team decided to go with a version 3 blurry background which create depth for the shot.</p>

      <p>"Penguin" is a short animation to convey the effect of global warming and pollution. The project is created for IAT343 Animation, produced by a team of four. The goal of the project is to create a short and cute animation that catches the audience's attention but results with a powerful ending. In the beginning of this project I worked on storyboarding, initial character design and concept research.</p>

      <p>In the developing process I was in charged with modeling and texturing components such as umbrella, table, deck chair, fishing rod, glass bottle and glass. Later in the process, I worked on building skeleton for the penguin and fishing rod, and the animatic of the penguin.</p>

      <p>Some challenge I faced during animating the character is its facial expression. The original idea was to create facial expression through placing two flat eyes on the penguin's face but we soon noticed that the facial expression looked unnatural. As a result, we decided to use a sunglass to represent its eyes and animate the sunglass to create facial expression as well as added characteristics to it.</p>
